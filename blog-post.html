            <h2>Jewellery Care Tips</h2>
            <p>Jewellery is not just an accessory; it is a reflection of your personality and style. To keep your jewellery looking its best, here are some essential care tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Always store your jewellery in a dry place, preferably in a soft cloth or a jewellery box to prevent scratches.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Chemicals:</strong> Keep your jewellery away from harsh chemicals, perfumes, and lotions that can tarnish or damage the metal and stones.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Cleaning:</strong> Clean your jewellery regularly with a soft cloth. For deeper cleaning, use a mild soap solution and a soft brush.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Water:</strong> Remove your jewellery before swimming or showering to avoid exposure to chlorine or saltwater.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Maintenance:</strong> Consider taking your jewellery to a professional jeweller for maintenance and repairs at least once a year.</li>
            </ul>
